    <h6> Antechamber of the CZAR'S private room. Large window at the
        back, with drawn curtains over it.</h6> the conversation  happing between people 
        <p> BARON RAFF (_shrugs his shoulders_). All young Czars do begin well.
            <br>
            COUNT R. And end badly.
            <br>
            [1]MARQ. DE POIV. Well, I have no right to complain. He has done me one
            good service, at any rate.
            <br>
            PRINCE PETRO. Cancelled your appointment to Archangel, I suppose?
            <br>
            MARQ. DE POIV. Yes; my head wouldn't have been safe there for an
            hour.[1]
            <br>
            (_Enter GENERAL KOTEMKIN._)
            <br>
            BARON RAFF. Ah! General, any more news of our romantic Emperor?
            <br>
            GEN. KOTEMK. You are quite right to call him romantic, Baron; a week ago
            I found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling
            players; to-day his whim is all the convicts in Siberia are to be
            recalled, and political prisoners, as he calls them, amnestied.
            <br>
            PRINCE PETRO. Political prisoners! Why, half of them are no better than
            common murderers!
            <br>
            COUNT R. And the other half much worse?
            <br>
            BARON RAFF. Oh, you wrong them, surely, Count. Wholesale trade has
            always been more respectable than retail.
            <br>
            COUNT R. But he is really too romantic. He objected yesterday to my
            having the monopoly of the salt tax. He said the people had a right to
            have cheap salt.
            <br>
            MARQ. DE POIV. Oh, that's nothing; but he actually disapproved of a
            State banquet every night because there is a famine in the Southern
            provinces. (_The young CZAR enters unobserved, and overhears the rest._)
            <br>
            PRINCE PETRO. Quelle b√©tise! The more starvation there is among the
            people, the better. It teaches them self-denial, an excellent virtue,
            Baron, an excellent virtue.
            <br>
            BARON RAFF. I have often heard so; I have often heard so.
            <br>
            GEN. KOTEMK. He talked of a Parliament, too, in Russia, and said the
            people should have deputies to represent them.
            <br>
            BARON RAFF. As if there was not enough brawling in the streets already,
            but we must give the people a room to do it in. But, Messieurs, the
            worst is yet to come. He threatens a complete reform in the public
            service on the ground that the people are too heavily taxed.
            <br>
            MARQ. DE POIV. He can't be serious there. What is the use of the people
            except[2] to get money out of? But talking of taxes, my dear Baron, you
            must really let me have forty thousand roubles to-morrow? my wife says
            she must have a new diamond bracelet.
            <br>
            COUNT R. (_aside to BARON RAFF_). Ah, to match the one Prince Paul gave
            her last week, I suppose.
            <br>
            PRINCE PETRO. I must have sixty thousand roubles at once, Baron. My son
            is overwhelmed with debts of honour which he can't pay.
            <br>
            BARON RAFF. What an excellent son to imitate his father so carefully!
            <br>
            GEN. KOTEMK. You are always getting money. I never get a single kopeck I
            have not got a right to. It's unbearable; it's ridiculous! My nephew is
            going to be married. I must get his dowry for him.
            <br>
            PRINCE PETRO. My dear General, your nephew must be a perfect Turk. He
            seems to get married three times a week regularly.
            <br>
            GEN. KOT. Well, he wants a dowry to console him.
            <br>
            COUNT R. I am sick of town. I want a house in the country.
            <br>
            MARQ. DE POIV. I am sick of the country. I want a house in town.
            <br>
            BARON RAFF. Mes amis, I am extremely sorry for you. It is out of the
            question.
            <br>
            PRINCE PETRO. But my son, Baron?
            <br>
            GEN. KOTEMK. But my nephew?
            <br>
            MARQ. DE POIV. But my house in town?
            <br>
            COUNT R. But my house in the country?
            <br>
            MARQ. DE POIV. But my wife's diamond bracelet?
            <br>
            BARON RAFF. Gentlemen, impossible! The old _regime_ in Russia is dead;
            the funeral begins to-day.
            <br>
            COUNT R. Then I shall wait for the resurrection.
            <br>
            PRINCE PETRO. Yes, but, _en attendant_, what are we to do?
            <br>
            BARON RAFF. What have we always done in Russia when a Czar suggests
            reforms?--nothing. You forget we are diplomatists. Men of thought should
            have nothing to do with action. Reforms in Russia are very tragic, but
            they always end in a farce.   </p>
