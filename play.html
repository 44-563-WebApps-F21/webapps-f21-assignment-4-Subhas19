    <h6 class="act"> Antechamber of the CZAR'S private room. Large window at the
        back, with drawn curtains over it.the conversation  happing between people </h6>
        <pre class="play">
            <h6 class="name baron">BARON RAFF</h6> 
            <p class="speech">Ah! General, any more news of our romantic Emperor?</p>

<h6 class="name gen">GEN. KOTEMK</h6> 
<p class="speech">You are quite right to call him romantic, Baron; a week ago
I found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling
players; to-day his whim is all the convicts in Siberia are to be
recalled, and political prisoners, as he calls them, amnestied.</p>

<h6 class="name prince">PRINCE PETRO</h6> 
<p class="speech">Political prisoners! Why, half of them are no better than
common murderers!</p>

<h6 class="name count">COUNT R</h6> 
<p class="speech">And the other half much worse?</p>

<h6 class="name baron">BARON RAFF</h6> 
<p class="speech">Oh, you wrong them, surely, Count. Wholesale trade has
always been more respectable than retail.</p>

<h6 class="name count">COUNT R</h6>
<p class="speech"> But he is really too romantic. He objected yesterday to my
having the monopoly of the salt tax. He said the people had a right to
have cheap salt.</p>

<h6 class="name marq">MARQ. DE POIV</h6>
<p class="speech"> Oh, that's nothing; but he actually disapproved of a
State banquet every night because there is a famine in the Southern
provinces.</p>
<p class="stage-direction"> (_The young CZAR enters unobserved, and overhears the rest._)</p>

<h6 class="name prince">PRINCE PETRO</h6> 
<p class="speech">Quelle b√©tise! The more starvation there is among the
people, the better. It teaches them self-denial, an excellent virtue,
Baron, an excellent virtue.</p>

<h6 class="name baron">BARON RAFF</h6> 
<p class="speech">I have often heard so; I have often heard so.</p>

<h6 class="name gen">GEN. KOTEMK</h6> 
<p class="speech">He talked of a Parliament, too, in Russia, and said the
people should have deputies to represent them.</p>

<h6 class="name baron">BARON RAFF</h6> 
<p class="speech">As if there was not enough brawling in the streets already,
but we must give the people a room to do it in. But, Messieurs, the
worst is yet to come. He threatens a complete reform in the public
service on the ground that the people are too heavily taxed.</p>

<h6 class="name marq">MARQ. DE POIV</h6> 
<p class="speech">He can't be serious there. What is the use of the people
except[2] to get money out of? But talking of taxes, my dear Baron, you
must really let me have forty thousand roubles to-morrow? my wife says
she must have a new diamond bracelet.</p>

<h6 class="name count">COUNT R</h6>
<p class="stage-direction">(_aside to BARON RAFF_).</p> 
<p class="speech">Ah, to match the one Prince Paul gave
her last week, I suppose.</p>

<h6 class="name prince">PRINCE PETRO</h6> 
<p class="speech">I must have sixty thousand roubles at once, Baron. My son
is overwhelmed with debts of honour which he can't pay.</p>

<h6 class="name baron">BARON RAFF</h6> 
<p class="speech">What an excellent son to imitate his father so carefully!</p>

<h6 class="name gen">GEN. KOTEMK</h6>
<p class="speech">You are always getting money. I never get a single kopeck I
have not got a right to. It's unbearable; it's ridiculous! My nephew is
going to be married. I must get his dowry for him.</p>

<h6 class="name prince">PRINCE PETRO</h6> 
<p class="speech">My dear General, your nephew must be a perfect Turk. He
seems to get married three times a week regularly.</p>

<h6 class="name gen">GEN. KOTEMK</h6>
<p class="speech"> Well, he wants a dowry to console him.</p>

<h6 class="name count">COUNT R.</h6>
<p class="speech"> I am sick of town. I want a house in the country.</p>

<h6 class="name marq">MARQ. DE POIV </h6>
<p class="speech">I am sick of the country. I want a house in town.</p>

<h6 class="name baron">BARON RAFF</h6>
<p class="speech"> Mes amis, I am extremely sorry for you. It is out of the
question.</p>

<h6 class="name prince">PRINCE PETRO</h6>
<p class="speech"> But my son, Baron?</p>

<h6 class="name gen">GEN. KOTEMK</h6>
<p class="speech"> But my nephew?</p>

<h6 class="name marq">MARQ. DE POIV</h6> 
<p class="speech">But my house in town?</p>

<h6 class="name count">COUNT R </h6>
<p class="speech"> But my house in the country?</p>

<h6 class="name marq">MARQ. DE POIV</h6>
<p class="speech"> But my wife's diamond bracelet?</p>

<h6 class="name baron">BARON RAFF</h6>
<p class="speech">Gentlemen, impossible! The old _regime_ in Russia is dead;
the funeral begins to-day.</p>

<h6 class="name count">COUNT R.</h6>
<p class="speech"> Then I shall wait for the resurrection.</p>

<h6 class="name prince">PRINCE PETRO</h6>
<p class="speech"> Yes, but, _en attendant_, what are we to do?</p>

<h6 class="name baron">BARON RAFF.</h6>
<p class="speech"> What have we always done in Russia when a Czar suggests
reforms?--nothing. You forget we are diplomatists. Men of thought should
have nothing to do with action. Reforms in Russia are very tragic, but
they always end in a farce.</p>

<h6 class="name count">COUNT R</h6>
<p class="speech"> I wish Prince Paul were here. [3]By the bye, I think this boy
is rather ungrateful to him. If that clever old Prince had not
proclaimed him Emperor at once without giving him time to think about
it, he would have given up his crown, I believe, to the first cobbler he
met in the street.</p>

<h6 class="name prince">PRINCE PETRO</h6>
<p class="speech"> But do you think, Baron, that Prince Paul is really
going?[3]</p>

<h6 class="name baron">BARON RAFF</h6>
<p class="speech"> He is exiled.</p>
